        I'm a web developer from London. I enjoy building web apps using
        JavaScript and React. I'm confident in writing modern JavaScript code,
        HTML and styling using either plain CSS or SASS. I am proficient in
        using Git and GitHub and know my way around the command line. I also
        have experience in using modern tooling and techniques such as WebPack,
        NPM, ESLint and TDD using Jest. I am also currently learning Node,
        Express and MongoDB.
