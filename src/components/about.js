        I am a front end developer from London. I enjoy building web apps using
        JavaScript and React. I am confident in writing semantic HTML and
        styling pages using CSS or SASS. I am proficient in using Git and GitHub
        for version control and know my way around the command line. I also have
        experience in using modern tooling and techniques such as WebPack, NPM,
        ESLint, TDD etc. I am currently looking for roles in front end
        development.
