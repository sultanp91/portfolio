        I'm a front end web developer from London. I enjoy building web apps
        using JavaScript and React. I'm confident in writing modern JavaScript
        code, HTML and styling using either plain CSS or SASS. I am proficient
        in using Git and GitHub and know my way around the command line. I also
        have experience in using modern tooling and techniques such as WebPack,
        NPM, ESLint and test driven development using Jest. I am also learning
        backend development with Node, Express and MongoDB.
