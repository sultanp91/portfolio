        I am a Front End developer from London. I am currently working through
        the full stack JavaScript course at The Odin Project, an open source
        project based curriculum. I enjoy taking complex problems, breaking them
        down into smaller problems and engineering understandable and performant
        solutions I have built mutiple projects with HTML, CSS and JavaScript -
        each project developing my understanding of JavaScript as a language and
        how to leverage it to create interactive experiences. I am confident
        with modern ES6 syntax, working with async code and have a solid
        understanding of JavaScript fundamentals such as scope, closure and
        objected oriented programming. I am passionate about React having built
        projects using both class and functional components with hooks. I am
        proficient with Git and modern tooling such as WebPack, NPM, ESLint and
        Prettier. My goal is to become a full stack developer and each day I
        become closer to that goal by learning and building every opportunity I
        get. I am currently looking for opportunities in web development. If you
        wish to know more about me please do not hesitate to ask.
